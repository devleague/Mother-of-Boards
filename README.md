# Mother-of-Boards
Hardware training exercise - identify PC components

## Preparation
- Poster images of motherboads
- Index cards with names of components written on it and a number to associate it to a marker (like an arrow)
  - numbered markers to help identify components on a poster

Motherboard images are located in the [mother-board-images](./mother-board-images/) directory.

These should be posted on the walls around the classroom. Index Cards (with accompanying marker), which have names of components written on it, will be placed around (not on) these posters.

## Activity
- Students will rotate to each poster and place ONE index card/marker identifying the component on the poster.
- Students must not place the a marker identifying a component that they have already identified on the previous poster (unless it's the last marker left).

## Wrap up
Together as a class, go through each poster and validate that each marker is identifying the correct component on the motherboard. Use this time to also review what the purpose of each component is.
